 * `interface collection` is the root interface in the collection hierarchy.
 * A collection represents a group of objects, known as its elements.  Some
 * collections allow duplicate elements and others do not.  Some are ordered
 * and others unordered. The JDK does not provide any direct
 * implementations of this interface: it provides implementations of more
 * specific sub interfaces like 'Set', 'List' and 'Collections.UnmodifiableCollection'.
 * 
 * 
 * This interface is typically used to pass collections around and manipulate them where
 * maximum generality is desired.
