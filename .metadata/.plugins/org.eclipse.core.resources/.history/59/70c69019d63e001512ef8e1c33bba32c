/*
 * Used to initialise instance variables. Called when you do

 * 
 * 1. No return type. You may have a return statement but it mustn't
 * return a value.
 * 
 * 2. Name must be the same as the class name.
 * 
 * 3. Every class including abstract class has at-least one constructor.
 * If you don't declare on the compiler inserts a default one taking no
 * parameters.
 * 
 * 4. Constructors are often overloaded. They cannot be overridden.
 * 
 * 5. may have any access modifier. A compiler supplied constructor has the 
 * same access modifier as the class.
 * 
 * 6. Whenever you call a class constructor its super class constructor 
 * is made to run first.
