package Serialization;


/*
 * 1) The 'transient' keyword prevents the values of instance fields 
 * that are declared with this keyword from being persisted when an 
 * object is serialized (written as a sequence of bytes to some 
 * destination). The values of such instance fields shouldn't be 
 * persisted and later restored when an object is deserialized 
 * (reconstituted from a sequence of bytes read from some source).
 * 
 * 2) For example, if your object has a field of type java.io.InputStream,
 * you don't serialize this field's reference because the stream won't be
 * open for input when you deserialize the object -- the stream source
 * (e.g., a file) might not exist.
 * 
 * How do I use transient?
 *
 * Include the transient modifier in the instance field's declaration. 
 * Below code presents a small demonstration.
