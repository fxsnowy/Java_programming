 * The load factor represents at what level the HashMap/HashTable

 * 
 * Default initial capacity of the 'HashMap' takes is 16 and load 
 * factor is 0.75f (i.e 75% of current map size). The load factor 
 * represents at what level the HashMap capacity should be doubled.
 * For example product of capacity and load factor as 16 * 0.75 = 12. This represents that after storing the 12th key â€“ value pair into the HashMap , its capacity becomes 32.
