/*

 * 1) A typical enterprise application will have multiple components
 * and will be distributed across various systems and networks. In 
 * Java, everything is represented as objects; if two Java components 
 * want to communicate with each other, there needs be a mechanism to 
 * exchange data. One way to achieve this is to define your own protocol 
 * and transfer an object. This means that the receiving end must know
 * the protocol used by the sender to re-create the object, which would 
 * make it very difficult to talk to third-party components. Hence, there 
 * needs to be a generic and efficient protocol to transfer the object 
 * between components. Serialisation is defined for this purpose, and 
 * Java components use this protocol to transfer objects.
 * 
 * How to serialise an object?
 * 
 * In order to serialise an object, you need to ensure that the class of
 * the object implements the java.io.Serializable interface, as shown below,
 *

/*
 * The Serializable interface is a marker interface; it declares no methods 
 * at all. It tells the serialization mechanism that the class can be serialized.
 * 
 * 
 * Now that you have made the class eligible for serialization, the next step is
 * to actually serialize the object. That is done by calling the writeObject() 
 * method of the java.io.ObjectOutputStream class, as shown below,
