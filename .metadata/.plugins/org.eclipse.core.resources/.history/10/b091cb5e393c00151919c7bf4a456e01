/*
 * 1) When you override a method you must not change the argument types
 * or their order. If you do change these you will simply get another 
 * method with the same name. This is called 'overloading'.
 * 
 * 2) A good method of an overloaded method is 'println'. To properly 
 * identify a method you need both the name and argument types.
