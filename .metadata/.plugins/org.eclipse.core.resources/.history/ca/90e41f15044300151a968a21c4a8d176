 * 1. If an instance initialiser can throw an exception then that 
 * exception must be declared in the throws clause of every constructor.
 * This is because the initialisation code is inserted after every call
 * to 'super' in the constructor.
 * 
 * 2. That exception can't be caught because constructors must start with 
 * 'super'  or 'this' not 'try'
